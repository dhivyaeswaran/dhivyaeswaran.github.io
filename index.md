## About Me

Since May 2020, I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I help innovate, develop, evaluate, and launch deep-learned models to fuel next-generation Amazon Search, with a focus on improving search quality in new and emerging locales.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Prof. Christos Faloutsos](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/) and supported partially by the [Snap Graduate Fellowship](https://snapresearchfs.splashthat.com/). My [thesis](./papers/dissertation.pdf) focused on anomaly detection and semi-supervised learning in graphs. Prior to that, I received my B.Tech. (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2015.

Outside of work, I like to run, play board games, solve puzzles, read, and travel. I am also learning *kathak*, a North Indian classical dance. I can be bribed with a good chai tea latte, some spicy *biriyani*, and a *basundhi*.

My CV is [here](./CV.pdf).
