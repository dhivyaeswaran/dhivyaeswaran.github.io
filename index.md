# About Me

Since May 2020, I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon A9 working on neural information retrieval.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Prof. Christos Faloutsos](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/) and supported partially by the [Snap Graduate Fellowship](https://snapresearchfs.splashthat.com/). My [thesis](./papers/dissertation.pdf) focused on anomaly detection and semi-supervised learning in graphs. Prior to that, I received my B.Tech. (Hons.) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2015.

Outside of work, I love board games and puzzles, enjoy reading and cooking, and am always on the lookout for opportunities to travel and explore. I can (easily) be bribed with a good chai tea latte and some spicy *biriyani*.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
